# My Todo App

This is a simple React + Redux + Axios Todo app 

## Features
- CRUD operations on todos (using JSONPlaceholder API)
- Uses Redux for state management
- Uses Axios for API calls

## Your Task
1. Fork the repo (Do not clone it)
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
3. Run the app (`npm run dev`).
4. Identify and fix the bugs (logic, Redux, Axios, React state/props).
5. Write a short explanation of what was wrong and how you fixed it.

Good luck!
